# Working hours
This is a small hobby project aiming to create a tool for logging your work.

## Idea
I needed something to log how much employees have worked per day. This has to be logged for weeks and months and eventually the work year.

## Progress
**This is still in progress. So if you clone it or use parts of this, be warned!**

- I have designed the framework, the necessary classes and handlers
- todo.md has the tasks list...
